Danel's deeds are not as well-known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly-forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did, indeed, flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end.  Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron."  

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could.  Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food, could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

The weapon saw a good amount of use in various barbarian hands as the years went by. Eventually, each owner found themselves hated for having the weapon in their possession. The taint of necromancy is so deplored by the northern tribes that the cursed name of Blood Iron became common knowledge among them. To this day, barbarians will not touch the cursed weapon and dislike even speaking of it. It is crafted of crude, poorly worked iron and the surface of the blade is covered in gouge marks and the imprint of bad hammer strikes. The grip is wrapped in bright red leather.

Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@10087 = ~In 834 DR, a wizard named Legedain the Wiser caught a renowned thief breaking into his tower. The thief was a cynical burglar named Ilfain Blackfeather. Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership.  Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Kossuth appeared in a gigantic bonfire and did battle with the enormous supernatural beast. The god's avatar triumphed over the octopus, but the monster did manage to damage Kossuth's essence. The divine fire raced through the creature's body and lodged in one of the creature's eyes, quickly transforming it into a bizarre black sphere lit by the flame within.

The wakizashi, or companion sword is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi, a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

The sword of the ninja, the ninja-to, is of lower quality than other Kara-Tur blades such as the katana. The ninja-to is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for the subterfuge of the ninja. The ninja-to is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai used.

"The only truth is that everyone dies." is printed upon the blade near the hilt in a demonic tongue. While holding this sword the wielder views the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost iridescent yellow green of infested pustule, are but a few of the things the wielder begins to relish.
The sword glows with a black icor when magic is used to reveal it's nature.  Necromancy's evil infests every part of the weapon. Those who would use such a foul sword, for them there is nothing more desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in unlife, continue to rot and decay.
Not much else can be learned about this sword other than its origins come from the Nine Hells.
