Danel's deeds are not as well-known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly-forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did, indeed, flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end.  Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron."

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could.  Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food, could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership.  Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.
